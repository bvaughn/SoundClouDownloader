Chrome extension enabling automatic downloads of any SoundCloud track, even when download option is disabled

## How do I use this extension?

This extension is not currently available in the Chrome web store, so you will need to follow [Google's instructions for how to load an unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).

Once you've installed the instruction, browse to [any SoundCloud song-page](https://soundcloud.com/brianvaughn/burn-you-away), right click, and select *SoundClouDownload all Mp3s*. At this point any SoundCloud song-page you visit (including the one you were already one) will be automatically downloaded to your *Downloads* directory.

To deactivate the plugin, right click and select *Stop SoundClouDownloading*.

## Requests? Suggestions?

This plugin was primarily written for fun, but if anyone finds it useful and has suggestions- please feel free to [create a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/bvaughn/SoundClouDownloader/issues/new).
